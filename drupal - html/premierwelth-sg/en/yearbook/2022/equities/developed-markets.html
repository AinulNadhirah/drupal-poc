              <h2>Developed Markets</h2>
              <p>Developed market (DM) equities have performed well last year with growth rebounding sharply on widespread vaccination. While we expect DM economic growth to remain healthy, there are some developing headwinds. Growth momentum is
                decelerating and we are seeing some changes on policy front as central banks and government worldwide look to recalibrate monetary and fiscal support. As such, we could see increased market volatility from time to time, requiring
                investors to increase their focus on building portfolio resilience.</p>

                  <p>Within DM, we are more positive on Japan with the country projected to see improving GDP growth in 2022 after the prolonged pandemic restrictions. In particular, a broader reopening of the economy should support the recovery of
                    domestic consumption. With the vaccination ramp up and favourable policy environment, we see scope for more positive earnings revision for Japan equities.
                  </p>
                  <p>In contrast, growth momentum in the U.S. and Europe is moderating but likely to remain above-trend. While earnings growth is projected to remain positive, the stretched valuations would limit the upside, leading to our neutral
                    stance on both markets.

                      <p>The easy phase of market recovery is firmly behind us. The U.S. is entering a more mature phase of the economic cycle amid the ongoing supply chain disruptions as well as normalisation of monetary policy. Still, the reopening
                        of the economy remains intact with advancement in vaccinations and COVID-19 treatments. This suggests demand for consumer services would likely accelerate, supporting economic growth. We forecast GDP growth to moderate to 4.0%
                        in 2022 from 5.7% in 2021, but remain comfortably above-trend, driven by service-led consumption. </p>

                      <p>U.S. equities have staged an impressive earnings rebound last year, with the S&P 500 earnings projected to grow by 46% in 2021 from a low base across most sectors. With healthy economic growth prospect, corporate earnings are
                        expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace of 8% in 2022. While the cyclically-oriented sectors such as Industrials and
                        Consumer Discretionary are projected to lead the growth, the Technology-related stocks are
                        also expected to deliver robust earnings as they continue to benefit from secular growth trends.</p>

                      <p>A key risk for the U.S. equity market, however, is the prospect of higher corporate taxes. A potential tax hike from 21% to 25%, alongside an additional hike to taxes on foreign income, could reduce S&P 500 earnings growth by
                        5% in 2022, with the technology sector likely to be affected more due to its relatively higher level of profitability. Nevertheless, the negative growth impact of the tax hikes could be offset by
                        increased fiscal (including infrastructure) spending
                        approved last year.</p>
                      <p>In addition, there are downside risks on profit margins in view of higher costs due to supply chain bottlenecks and labour shortages issues. That said, U.S. corporates have largely been able to pass on the higher costs and
                        defend their profitability. While the S&P 500 profit margin declined from 13.1% (2Q21) to 12.9% (3Q21), it remained above the 5-year average of 10.9%. An easing of the supply constraints in 2H22 could lend further support to
                        prevent a significant margin decline.</p>

                      <p>Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, U.S. equities are still likely to deliver positive returns in 2022 on the back of healthy earnings growth and supportive financial conditions. Nevertheless, the upside may be more
                        moderated with the S&P 500 already trading at 21x forward price-to-earnings, which is higher than the 5-year historical average of 18x.</p>
                      <p>In view of the above, we are neutral on U.S. equities, preferring to position towards consumer recovery plays as these companies will likely benefit from elevated consumer savings and a pick up in demand for services.
                        Meanwhile, we stay neutral on the Technology
                        sector as rising bond yields may weigh on its
                        valuation, particularly for those high growth preearnings
                        stocks. Nevertheless, there are still selected opportunities within the
                        segment especially for companies that are well-positioned to benefit from long-term secular growth trends including digital consumption, cloud computing and cybersecurity and still trading on relatively reasonable valuations.

                      <p>While European equities could make further gains, we
                        may not see a repeat of last yearâ€™s stellar performance in
                        2022. With the MSCI Europe trading above historical
                        average valuation based on consensus forward price-to-earnings ratio, we are not anticipating any meaningful
                        re-rating of the market multiples. As such, the market
                        returns this year will be largely dependent on earnings
                        growth, which is projected to grow by 6% in 2022. Notably,
                        the earnings revision momentum may start to turn less

                      <p>In view of the above, we are neutral on Europe. Nevertheless, we continue to see pockets of opportunities within the region. In particular, Europe remains a good hunting ground for dividend plays. With interest rates

                    <div class="card-body ">
                      <p>Within Europe, we prefer the Healthcare and
                        Telecommunications sectors given the healthy
                        dividend yields and reasonable valuations.
                        Specifically, there are a number of healthcare
                        companies in the region with global market
                        leadership that could benefit from structural
                        growth in healthcare demand. Meanwhile,
                        Telecommunications stocks in Europe could see
                        stronger growth with a broader roll-out of 5G
                        services. The resumption of international travel may
                        also offer a boost to data roaming revenues.</p>
                      <p>In contrast, we believe a more selective approach
                        towards Banks and Energy stocks may be required.
                        While European banks will continue to benefit
                        from a robust macro environment, the positives may
                        have been priced in. As such, we prefer to stick with
                        banks that have executed well and are still trading at
                        reasonable valuations including those with more
                        exposure to higher growth regions such as Asia.
                        Similarly, the positives of higher oil prices have been
                        largely priced in for the Energy sector, which
                        continues to face structural challenges as the world
                        looks to shift away from fossil fuels to
                        renewable sources. As such, we would prefer energy
                        companies that can cope with the transition as they
                        are more likely to emerge as winners over the long run.</p>

                      <p>Valuation wise, Japan equities are trading relatively
more attractive than their other global peers. Notably,
MSCI Japan is trading at a forward price-to-earnings
ratio of 14.0x versus MSCI All-Country (AC) World at
17.5x.</p>
                      <p>Given the improving growth prospects, we see
scope for Japan equities to play catch-up and are
hence overweight Japan. Longer-term, the continued
focus on improving corporate governance may also
boost profitability and consequently returns for
investors.
                      </p>
                      <p>Sectors wise, we favour Industrial stocks that
have well-established global presence that could
benefit from stronger capital spending across
the globe. Meanwhile, consumer-related companies
that could benefit from a pick up in domestic
spending could also do well with further reopening
of the economy. Longer-term, the creation of a
digital government agency could accelerate the push
for digitalisation in Japan and benefit the related
technology companies.
