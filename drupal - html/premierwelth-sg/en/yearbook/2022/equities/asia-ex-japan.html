                  <p>Asia ex-Japan equities were amongst the weaker performers in 2021 as the outlook was tempered by the slower reopening of economies and a spate of regulatory actions in China. Nevertheless, the region could perform better in 2022
                    in view of stronger earnings growth potential as well as more attractive valuation relative to DM. </p>

                        <p>We expect GDP growth rates in Asia ex-Japan to outpace that of advanced economies in 2022, driven by further reopening with rising vaccination rates. Meanwhile, inflation will remain largely in check across Asia, giving
                          central banks in the region room to retain their accommodative stance. The positive macro outlook will lend support to Asia ex-Japan's earnings growth, which is projected at 8.9%. Coupled with the more attractive valuation,
                          we are overweight Asia ex-Japan as we expect market leadership to rotate towards the region in 2022. </p>
                        <p>We remain selectively biased towards China, Singapore and Indonesia equities. In contrast, we are
                          less sanguine on India alongside Taiwan and Thailand given the expensive valuations. Sectors wise, we continue to advocate a
                          balanced approach between value cyclicals that could benefit from further reopening and secular plays that offer exposure to structural growth trends.</p>

                        <p>China’s push for common prosperity may speed up the economic rebalancing towards consumption and services, and reduce reliance on investments and exports. These policies are arguably positive for China’s long-term
                          sustainability, but it came at a time when the economic momentum is also slowing and could exacerbate China’s soft patch in the near-term. Some of these policies including addressing monopolistic behaviour, providing more
                          equal opportunities in education, and property tax reform, could weigh on the private sector that has been a vital engine of growth and jobs. </p>

                        <p>Still, we believe these policies would be carefully recalibrated to the needs of the economy. In our view, China has already frontloaded the regulatory tightening and fiscal consolidation. Looking ahead, a more neutral
                          fiscal stance, coupled with moderately supportive monetary policy could cushion the economic slowdown. We also anticipate a shift in China’s “Zero COVID-19” strategy to “Living with COVID-19” ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter
                          Olympics in February, further lending support to the recovery of private demand for services.</p>

                        <p>China’s corporate earnings rebounded from -9.3% in
                          2020 to 10.4% in 2021E, largely driven by the cyclical
                          industries amid reopening of the economy. However, the
                          cyclical sectors that are unable to pass on the rising costs

                        <p>China was one of the worst performing markets
                          in 2021 as investors digested the tighter
                          regulatory environment, growth headwinds, and rising
                          default risks in the property sector. Notably, MSCI

                          greater investment opportunities in the technologyrelated
                          stocks which have been hurt by tighter

                <p>China and Hong Kong are the only major countries that are still pursuing a “Zero COVID-19” strategy, which increases the risk of intermittent lockdowns. We expect this to pose a constraint on the pace of Hong Kong’s GDP growth to
                  just 3.0% in 2022. Still, corporate earnings growth will likely remain healthy at 19.8% in 2022, underpinned
by the financial and Macau gaming sectors. However, policy risks in the property sector could pose some headwinds, leading
                  to our neutral stance on Hong Kong.

                    <p>Further rate hikes could lead to tighter financial conditions and weigh on overall market performance in 2022. Notably, South Korea’s expected earnings decline of 4.3% in 2022 also pales in comparison to its regional peers.

                    <h4>Demanding valuations in Taiwan</h4>
                    <p>In Taiwan, the expected 1.2% earnings decline in 2022 is also unappealing. Coupled with demanding valuations, we are underweight Taiwan. MSCI Taiwan is trading at FY22E price-to-book ratio of 2.4x, which is at a huge
                      premium to MSCI South Korea’s 1.1x book value and MSCI Asia ex-Japan’s 1.6x book value.</p>

                <h3>India (Underweight)</h3>
                <h4>Little room for disappointment</h4>
                <p>Thanks to the strong domestic inflows, 2021 has been a
                  good year for Indian markets despite concerns about the
                  sustainability of its post-pandemic economic recovery.
                  Nevertheless, vaccination coverage in India remains
low and offers little safeguard against a new wave of
COVID-19 infections.</p>

                    <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will likely keep monetary policies accommodative given emerging stresses in the banking sector and current account balance. Having said that, rate hikes in the U.S. could pressure the RBI to
                      change its stance to prevent a reversal of capital flows and currency depreciation. Meanwhile, India’s demanding valuations also leave very little room for setbacks, be it on the macro or earnings front. We are underweight on
                      India in 2022 given the unattractive risk-reward outlook.</p>

                <h3>Singapore (Overweight)</h3>
                <p>We are positive on Singapore equities as the market
                  is anticipated to sustain its positive momentum
                  into 2022. Although Singapore's GDP growth is
                  projected to moderate this year, the economy
                  remains in good shape. In particular, we expect a pick
                  up in services sector growth, which could help offset the
                  potential slowdown in manufacturing. The government
                  is also unlikely to revert to stringent COVID-19
                  mobility restrictions as long as the healthcare system
                  is not overloaded. </p>

                    <p>Valuation wise, MSCI Singapore is trading on
                      FY22E price-to-earnings ratio of 15x as at end-
                      November 2021, which seems reasonable when
                      compared to the projected double-digit earnings
                      growth in 2022. Sectors wise, Singapore
                      banks may benefit from stronger loan
                      growth, particularly from the small-medium
                      enterprises. We also expect an increase in both
                      outbound and inbound travel, which will benefit
                      companies with related exposure to sectors such as
                      retail, hospitality and transport services.</p>

                <h3>Malaysia (Neutral)</h3>
                <p>Malaysia’s GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 6.0%
                  in 2022 after a sluggish recovery last year. With a high level
                  of vaccination, it has enabled the government to
                  ease mobility restrictions including allowing interstate
                  travel since 4Q21. Malaysia equities are also
                  trading on relatively cheaper valuations when
                  compared to other ASEAN peers. Having said that, the
                  surprise Cukai Makmur “prosperity tax” has weighed on
                  sentiment given the one-off impact on corporate earnings.
                  The government may also call for an earlier general election
                  in 2022, which may result in heightened political uncertainties. As
                  such, the upside potential of the market could be limited,
                  leading to our neutral stance.</p>

                <p>With its GDP having returned to pre-pandemic levels
                  in 2021, Indonesia looks set to sustain its growth
                  momentum in 2022. As vaccination rate continues to rise,
                  the country is expected to witness stronger
                  domestic consumption growth with consumer
                  confidence rebounding. Meanwhile, the robust
                  commodity pricing environment should also remain
                  supportive. With earnings revision turning positive,
                  there is scope for Indonesia equities to play catch-up
                  this year. Longer-term, the structural positives of
                  Omnibus Law and digitisation of economy should also
                  appeal to investors. As such, we are overweight on Indonesia
                  and expect the market to re-rate higher from the
                  current undemanding valuation.</p>

                <p>The Philippines economy should rebound further with the improving COVID-19 situation in the country. This bodes well for equity markets which will benefit from a pick up in domestic economic activities. In fact, corporate
                  earnings revision has started to show signs of stabilisation. Nevertheless, the upcoming elections in May 22 may pose some uncertainties with President Rodrigo Duterte announcing his retirement. While the market valuation is
                  inexpensive, we prefer to stay neutral until there is more clarity on the political front.</p>

                <h3>Thailand (Underweight)</h3>
                <p>With an acceleration in vaccine roll-out, the Thai economy
                  is expected to benefit from the gradual lifting of border
                  restrictions, particularly the tourism sector. Nevertheless,
                  the positives may have been priced in with the
                  market trading at one standard deviation above historical
                  average valuation. As such, the market remains relatively
                  more vulnerable to other ASEAN peers, particularly if the
                  earnings revision momentum were to turn negative. In
                  view of the above, we are underweight on Thailand.</p>
