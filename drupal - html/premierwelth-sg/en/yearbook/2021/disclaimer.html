              <p>This report is for information purposes only and under no circumstances is it or any part of it to be considered or intended as an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the financial or investment products
                referred to herein (each, a “Product”, and collectively, “Products”), or an offer or solicitation to any person to enter into any transaction or adopt any investment strategy or enter into any legal relations, or an advice or a
                recommendation with respect to such Products. </p>
              <p><strong>Investors should note that income from such Products, if any, may fluctuate and that each Product’s price or value may rise or fall.</strong> Accordingly, investors may receive back less than what they have originally
                invested or they may also not receive back anything at all from what they have originally invested. <strong>All investments involve an element of risk, including capital and principal loss. Past performance is not necessarily a guide
                  to or an indication of future performance. </strong></p>
              <p>This report is prepared for general circulation. It is not intended to provide personal investment advice and does not take into account the specific investment objectives, financial situation and particular needs of any particular
                recipient or reader and thus should be read with this in mind. An investor should therefore independently and separately evaluate and assess each Product and consider the suitability of the same and the risks involved or the
                investment strategies discussed or illustrated in this report, taking into account the investor’s specific investment objectives, financial situation, risk tolerance and particular needs, and seek independent financial, audit, tax,
                legal and/or other professional advice as necessary, before dealing, transacting and/or investing in any of the Products mentioned in this report or communicated to the investor as a follow-up to this report. All investments will be
                made solely upon and in reliance on the investor’s own judgment and discretion, notwithstanding any opinion, commentary or recommendation this report, Maybank or its Relationship Managers may provide. Unless expressly agreed
                otherwise, Maybank offers no investment, financial, legal, tax or any other type of advice to recipients or readers of this report. Maybank has no fiduciary duty towards any such recipients and readers, and makes no representation
                and gives no warranty as to the results to be obtained from any investment, strategy or transaction, or as to whether any strategy, security or transaction described herein may be suitable for the financial needs, circumstances or
                requirements of the recipients and readers. </p>
              <p>Some of the information herein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable but such sources have not been independently verified by Maybank and consequently no representation and/or warranty is made by Maybank as to the

                its officers, directors, associates, connected parties and/or employees, including persons involved in the preparation or issuance of this report, may from time to time have positions or be materially interested in the Products
                referred to herein and may further act as market maker or may have assumed an underwriting commitment or deal with such Products and may also perform or seek to perform investment banking, advisory or other services in relation
                thereto. One or more directors, officers and/or employees of Maybank may be a director of any of the corporations of the Products mentioned in this report to the extent permitted by law. Accordingly, Maybank may have a conflict of
