                    <p>The MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan Index tumbled 18% in 1Q20 due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The stunning rebound since then was even more striking, underpinned by unwavering expectations that the global economy
                      would bounce back once the pandemic is under control, as well as the swift and aggressive responses from the central banks and governments. </p>

                            Corporate earnings are also expected to rebound by 24.9% in 2021 from -2.9% in 2020. </p>

                          <p>Notably, technology stocks led the market rebound in 2020, reflecting a transition to an increasingly technology-driven economy in the region as well as the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the digital
                            transformation across consumer spending and behaviour, and consequently accelerated the demand for new technology infrastructure. </p>
                          <p>In our view, these secular growth themes remain an opportunity for investors. Within the region, we believe markets such as China that have a higher exposure to these secular growth themes will continue to outperform

                            having already returned to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020. In fact, we expect Chinaâ€™s economy to expand 7.5% in 2021, posting the fastest expansion since 2013. </p>

                            14th Five-Year plan to foster a new, dual circulation development architecture which will focus on stimulating domestic consumption while relying less on global integration. Meanwhile, improving Chinaâ€™s technological

                            pre-pandemic levels. Thus, the frequency and pace of interest rates cuts and lowering of banksâ€™ reserve requirement ratio would likely be much reduced in 2021 as compared with the first half of 2020.</p>

                          <p>While the risks of geopolitical tensions, unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising credit excesses remain, Chinaâ€™s continued economic recovery, coupled with supportive fiscal and monetary policies should
                            provide a conducive environment for Chinese corporate earnings and consequently the stock market. Notably, Chinaâ€™s corporate earnings are projected to rebound from -2.3% in 2020 to +19.1% in 2021, led by the Consumer
                            Discretionary and Communications Services sectors. We expect these sectors to be supported by both government policies and sector-specific growth opportunities. In addition, we also see attractive value in the Industrial
                            and Insurance sectors with both projected to post robust earnings growth in 2021. </p>
                          <p>A potential headwind though for Chinese equities may be the rising valuation. Chinese stocks are no longer as cheap relative to the historical valuation range after the strong rally in 2020. Notably, MSCI China is
                            trading at 2021 price-to-earnings ratio of 15.2x, the highest level since 2009. Nevertheless, the market still looks undemanding when compared to global peersâ€™ average of 19.3x. </p>

                  <h3>South Korea (Overweight) / Taiwan (Neutral)</h3>
                  <h4>South Korea â€“ still under-appreciated by investors</h4>
                  <p>Given their better pandemic management, the North Asian economies had generally been more resilient when compared to global peers. Notably, Taiwan and South Koreaâ€™s economies were relatively unscathed by the pandemic, with
                    Taiwan expected to post a GDP growth of 1.6% in 2020 and South Koreaâ€™s GDP to contract by just 1.1%. </p>

                      <p>In addition, South Korea and Taiwan are well-positioned to benefit from the strong technology sector as they are the largest and most advanced producers of semiconductor chips which are the critical components of electronics
                        devices. </p>
                      <p>On a relative basis, we believe that South Korea offers a better risk-reward than Taiwan in 2021. The improving economy will lend support to South Koreaâ€™s corporate earnings, with earnings growth accelerating from 19.1% in
                        2020 to 41.7% in 2021. In contrast, Taiwanâ€™s corporate earnings will only grow by 13.2% in 2021. South Korea is also trading at attractive FY21E price-to-book ratio of 1.2x, compared to Taiwan at 2.3x. We believe that
                        investors have yet to fully discount South Koreaâ€™s strong earning recovery and thus the upside risks will likely be higher. We are overweight on South Korea and neutral on Taiwan. </p>

                  <p>Due to the influx of liquidity, Indiaâ€™s stock market has been rising since March 2020 despite only passing the peak of its elongated first wave of COVID-19 infections in September 2020. The daily new cases are slowing down in
                    India and the economy is expected to normalise and return to positive year-on-year growth in Julyâ€“September 2021. That said, until a vaccine emerges for the mass population, India remains highly vulnerable given its large
                    population and weak healthcare infrastructure. </p>

                      <p>Positively, Indiaâ€™s corporate earnings downgrades have largely stabilised. Earnings are expected to strongly rebound to +40.7% in 2021 from -7.9% in 2020, underpinned by the Information Technology, Consumer Staples and Oil &
                        Gas sectors. However, we are mindful of Indiaâ€™s demanding valuations, which leaves little room for earnings disappointment. Thus, we are neutral on the market given the balanced risk-reward. </p>

                  <p>The performance of Singapore equities is expected to stabilise after the steep pull-back witnessed in 2020. With GDP growth projected to rebound from -5.7% in 2020 to 4.5% in 2021, the improving economy should help to arrest the
                    decline. Nevertheless, the upside may be capped by the marketâ€™s significant exposure to cyclical equities. Any meaningful rebound would kick in only when there is a broader recovery of the global economy. Still, the downside is
                    limited as MSCI Singapore trades at FY21E price-to-book ratio of 1.1x as at end-November 2020, in line with historical averages. As such, we are neutral on Singapore. </p>

                      <p>Sectors wise, Singapore banks may continue to face pressure on interest income although concerns on non-performing loans should abate as the economy recovers. Meanwhile, the real estate investment trusts (REITs) remain a
                        fertile ground for dividend plays. In particular, the performance of industrial and infrastructure-related REITs should remain resilient while the retail REITs could also gradually recover from increasing shopper traffic. </p>

                    supernormal profits following the surge in demand and selling prices for their products arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The glove manufacturers could continue to lend support to the market in 2021 barring the risk of a
                    windfall tax on the sector. Meanwhile, the fragile coalition government is also adding to the political uncertainties that could weigh on investor sentiment. Having said that, Malaysian equities are trading on relatively
